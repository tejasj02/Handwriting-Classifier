UC Berkeley CS188 (Artificial Intelligence) project:

• Built a neural network that classified handwritten digits from 0-9 with 97% accuracy
• Implemented a language identifier using a neural network that categorized individual words as either English, Spanish, Finnish, Dutch, or Polish with accuracy above 80%.
• Experimented with different components such as batch size, learning rate, and neural network structure
