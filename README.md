• Built a neural network that classified handwritten digits from 0-9 with 97% accuracy <br/>
• Implemented a language identifier using a neural network that categorized individual words as either English, Spanish, Finnish, Dutch, or Polish with accuracy above 80% <br/>
• Experimented with different components such as batch size, learning rate, and neural network structure
